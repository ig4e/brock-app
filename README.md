# Brock App 🎪
*Warning: This README contains dad jokes. Proceed with caution!*

## Introduction 
Why did the developer go broke? Because he used up all his cache! 

But seriously folks, Brock App is a modern, full-stack application built with an Expo app for the frontend and a Node.js API for the backend. It's so full-stack, it makes pancakes jealous! 🥞

## Tech Stack 🥞
*(Get it? Because it's a stack... I'll see myself out)*

- **Frontend**: Expo (React Native) - Because nobody likes a boring UI
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express - Running faster than your coffee break
- **Database**: Prisma - Prettier than your ex's Instagram feed
- **Hosting**: Koyeb - Where your code goes to grow up

## Prerequisites 📝
*(Why did the developer need prerequisites? Because they didn't want to NULL and void their contract!)*

Before you begin, ensure you have:
- Node.js and npm (No, not the noodle company)
- An Expo account (It's like Facebook, but for cool developers)
- A Koyeb account (Sounds like a Pokémon, works like magic)
- A sense of humor (You'll need it for these jokes)
- Coffee ☕ (Optional but highly recommended)

## Setup Instructions 🛠️
*(What did the terminal say to the developer? "I've got some setup lines for you!")*

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd brock-app-master # Welcome to your new home!
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```sh
    npm install # Watch the progress bar, it's like a loading screen game
    ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
    ```sh
    cp .env.example .env # The most copying and pasting you'll do all day
    ```

4. **Run the API**:
    ```sh
    cd apps/api
    npm start # Crosses fingers automatically
    ```

5. **Run the Expo app**:
    ```sh
    cd apps/expo
    expo start # Magic happens here ✨
    ```

## Deploying to Koyeb 🚀
*(Why did the deployment feel lonely? Because it was pushed away!)*

1. Sign in to Koyeb (No password juggling required... just kidding, you'll need that)

2. Create a new app:
   - Click "Create App" (The big friendly button)
   - Choose "GitHub" as the source (Git it? Git it? 😉)

3. Configure build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
   - Cross fingers: `Required`

4. Set environment variables (Like leaving notes for your future self)

5. Deploy and pray to the coding gods 🙏

## Project Structure 🏗️
*(Our folder structure is so clean, Marie Kondo would be proud)*

- **apps**: Where the magic happens
  - `api`: The backend (like the kitchen of a restaurant)
  - `expo`: The frontend (like the fancy dining room)
- **packages**: Shared goodies (like the pantry)
- **tooling**: Developer toys (I mean, tools)

## Contributing 🤝
